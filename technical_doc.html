Even if you don’t consider yourself a creative person, it’s still a good idea to 
learn web design. No matter whether you want to make static websites or dynamic web
 applications, design is an important part of the process. The design is the first 
 thing people notice when they arrive on a website, and if it’s not good enough, 
 they’ll leave. You don’t want to create a site that frustrates people, do you?</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="CSS"> <header> CSS </header> <p>Stands for "Cascading Style Sheet." Cascading style sheets are used to format the layout of Web pages. They can be used to define text styles, table sizes, and other aspects of Web pages that previously could only be defined in a page's HTML.
</p>
    <code> // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
}
        </code>
        
        <p>
CSS helps Web developers create a uniform look across several pages of a Web site. Instead of defining the style of each table and each block of text within a page's HTML, commonly used styles need to be defined only once in a CSS document. Once the style is defined in cascading style sheet, it can be used by any page that references the CSS file. Plus, CSS makes it easy to change styles across several pages at once. For example, a Web developer may want to increase the default text size from 10pt to 12pt for fifty pages of a Web site. If the pages all reference the same style sheet, the text size only needs to be changed on the style sheet and all the pages will show the larger text. </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Java_Script"> <header> Java Script</header><p> JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development. It was originally developed by Netscape as a means to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites. While JavaScript is influenced by Java, the syntax is more similar to C and is based on ECMAScript, a scripting language developed by Sun Microsystems.

        <code> // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
}
        </code>
        
        <p>
JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, which means the source code is processed by the client's web browser rather than on the web server. This means JavaScript functions can run after a webpage has loaded without communicating with the server. For example, a JavaScript function may check a web form before it is submitted to make sure all the required fields have been filled out. The JavaScript code can produce an error message before any information is actually transmitted to the server.</p>
